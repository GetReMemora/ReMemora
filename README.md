# ReMemora  
**“Things I forgot I wrote.”**  
*A code memory infrastructure for developers and teams.*

---

### What is ReMemora?

ReMemora helps developers **find, reuse, and remix** their past work—without digging through endless folders or searching vague repo names.

It’s like a second brain for your codebase.  
Surfacing **forgotten functions**, **prompt snippets**, and **reusable components**—from *your* projects and *your* team.

---

### The Story of the Name

> ReMemora is short for “Remembering Memoranda”—but it’s also inspired by the **remora fish**, a clever creature that rides alongside larger hosts, remembering and adapting to its environment.  

Just like its namesake, ReMemora follows your projects, **learning what’s useful** and **making it easy to reuse**.

---

### The “Re-” Philosophy

- **Reuse** the best work from your past  
- **Rediscover** valuable code buried in dusty repos  
- **Remember** what your team already solved  
- **Reclaim** time lost rebuilding the same solutions  

---

### What ReMemora Will Do

- 🔍 **Scan** your codebase to extract reusable components  
- ✏️ **Summarize** each piece in plain English  
- 🏷️ **Tag** them with helpful labels  
- 🧠 **Learn** over time what’s most valuable to reuse  
- 🤖 **Suggest** components with a simple prompt

---

### Status

The ReMemora codebase is currently **under development**.  
We’re actively working on:

- Component extraction + summarization  
- Tagging and scoring  
- Agentic memory (LangGraph pipeline)  
- GitHub integration and cross-project memory  
- 🖥Simple UI (Streamlit or FastAPI)
